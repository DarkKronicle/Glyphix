# Glyphix

A mod to improve font support for Minecraft.

## Features

- **100% client side**. Anyone who has this mod will see emojis as properly rendered.
- Full [twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) support by default
- Proper width calculations. Because emojis are multiple characters, Minecraft has a hard time dealing with width, but
- Different emoji atlases
- Fast. This mod does not improve vanilla speed, but even with more features it does not slow down. If I can think of a way to speed up vanilla that will definitely get added to this mod.

This mod is still in **beta** because overhauling Minecraft's font is super finicky. If there are any bugs, please report them to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/DarkKronicle/Glyphix/issues).

## How to use emojis

Just copy and paste the raw emoji. In [unicode.org](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) it's the `browser` column. Anything in the `twitter` column should work by default.

## Planned Features

- Ligature support from `.ttf` fonts. Emojis are essentially just ligatures so it probably won't be too hard to add more support.
- Use an actual bold font when rendering bold. Currently Minecraft just renders text twice when it is supposed to be bold, I want to add support for a specified bold font.
- Use an actual italic font when rendering italic. Currently minecraft just slices text.
- Fix some weird `.ttf` bugs. There are some inaccuracies with spacing and `.ttf` font. Another goal of the project is to make it render correctly.
- Text box weirdness with emojis. Textboxes uses string length and not glyph length for some calculations which can make rendering weird. Fixing these will require a bit of work, but should improve usability.
- Chat hooks to automatically convert strings like `:grinning_face:` -> ðŸ˜€ for incoming and outgoing messages.
- Other built in emoji fonts

## Changing Emoji Atlas

There is a script `./scripts/emoji_atlas.py` that will convert a directory of emojis into an atlas with JSON file specifying locations. The emojis name has to be `<unicode>.png` with multi-character emojis as `<unicode>-<unicode>.png` and so on. It shouldn't be too hard to modify the python script to change the names if there is a different naming scheme for whatever emojis you choose.

The script will generate 2 files. `emoji_atlas.png` and `emoji_positions.png`. Put these into a resourcepack under `assets/glyphix/emoji/`. Reload texturepacks and the new emojis should render correctly.

Currently, emojis have to be **square** for them to render correctly.
